# Hirakata: Your Japanese Learning Companion

This app offers interactive flashcards to practice Japanese scripts and improve your language skills. You can engage with these flashcards, enhance your character recognition, and test your knowledge in a quiz-based format. Additionally, the app provides three main options for customization:

- Select Script Sets: Choose from Hiragana, Katakana, or both to tailor your practice sessions.
- Custom Card Sets: Practice with specific sets of characters, such as vowels, consonants, or individual lines (e.g., s line, k line).
- Quiz Mode: Enter romanization of characters and receive feedback on your answers, with additional features coming soon!

Look forward to future updates that will further enrich your learning experience!

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/hirakata-flashcards.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd hirakata-flashcards
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.\
The page will reload when you make changes.\
Any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more details, see the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
The build is optimized and minified for the best performance.\
Your app is now ready for deployment.

For deployment instructions, see [Create React App deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you need to customize the build tool and configuration, you can eject. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project. You can then tweak them as needed.
